# Book-Store-Project-MYSQL
This project analyzes sales, customer behavior, and book performance using a relational database built in MySQL. It includes three main tables: Books, Orders, and Customers. Using advanced SQL queries—including window functions, aggregation, and joins—the project uncovers key insights such as:
Top-selling books by genre and year
Customer purchase trends and lifetime value
Cumulative sales and running totals
Ranking and performance comparisons using window functions
Percentage contribution of books to overall revenue
Ideal for anyone learning SQL for analytics or building portfolio-level database projects.
